#### Project Rubrics
* Assessment of projects follows 5-point rubrics in three categories:
    * 50% Content
    * 25% Documentation
    * 25% Commit Practice

* The **Content** category assesses the technical correctness of a studentâ€™s program.
    * __5__ All programming tasks were met with correct algorithms applied.  Code is free of errors - programatic and syntactic.  Abstraction makes code efficient and easy to read.
    * __4__ Most programming tasks met with correct algorithms applied.  Or code has one or two programatic errors.  Or code has repetitive blocks and not sensible abstraction.
    * __3__ Not all programming tasks met.  Or code has many programatic errors.  Or code has any syntactical errors (i.e. does not run).  Or code does not reflect algorithms studied in class. Or code severely lacks abstraction.
    * __2__ A few programming tasks were met with some success.
    * __1__ One or two programming tasks met.

* The **Documentation** category assesses the practice of code documentation.  This includes comments, as well as README files for software artifacts.  Good documentation develops academic literacy.
    * __5__  Code has excellent comments where needed - concise, helpful, and not redundant.  The README file gives clear, grammatically correct instructions for using the code base.
    * __4__  Code has excellent comments.  Redundant comments describe code that is unmistakable in meaning.  Or excessive comments detract from overall clarity.
    * __3__  Code has substantial commenting.  Documentation lacks a critical features that a developer should know about to maintain the code base.  Or many redundant or excessive comments.
    * __2__  Code has few comments.  Or multiple key features, complex statements, or other critical parts of the code are not well documented.
    * __1__  Code has almost no comments. Or README file remains unchanged.

* The **Commit Practice** category assesses the use of Git and code revision.  Commit Practice relates to documentation, in some ways.
    * __5__ Repository contains many commits.  Clear commit messages describe changes or additions to code.  Overall, commits contain running - not breaking - code.  Commits represent logically discrete steps in problem solving.  The correct [imperative tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) is used in commit messages. The practice of branching separates major changes and parallel development - such as when collaborating - in a controlled way. 
    * __4__ Repository contains many commits.  Some commit messages lack clarity, meaning, or the correct tense.  Or many commits contain code that does not run.
    * __3__ Repository contains fewer, larger commits.  Commits represent large steps of progress.  Or too many smaller commits are made that should be combined.  Or many commits contain code that does not run. Or many commits have meaningless messages.
    * __2__ Far too few commits for a large assignment.
    * __1__ One commit.
